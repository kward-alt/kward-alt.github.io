Welcome! I am Kayleigh Ward, an environmental sociologist, community engaged researcher, and public health advocate. 

I am research faculty within the Environmental Science Innovation and Impact Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder, and a lecturer with the Department of Public Health and Health Sciences at Northeastern University. I am a environmental sociologist, public health advocate and policy scholar who investigates how public water utilities’ values, governance, and policy designs shape water affordability, water poverty and environmental justice in the United States. In broader contexts, I focuse on disparate burdens and impacts, by highlighting how environmental health of both urban and rural populations suffer from poor social and environmental policy. Across these difference issues, I use actionable, public-facing evidence to translate findings into practical recommendations to improve equity, reduce water poverty and support just, sustainable infrastructure in urban and rural communities.

### The wonderful world of Timberdoodles (aka American Woodcock)
![Adult American Woodcock from ebird](img/American_Woodcock_Adult_Bird.png) 

Some years ago when I was working in Boston a coworker of mine got me into birding. Birding is one of those hobbies that you do not do by half. One of my first sightings was an American Woodcock, also lovingly known as a Timberdoodle. They are also characterized by the males' signature PEENT! call and their undulating strut. There has been a lot of speculation both by ornithologists (bird scientists) and birders as to why Timberdoodles do this. Beyond struting during their displays, some believe that this helps them coax worms out of the soil, while others contend it may be a way to confuse potential predators due to the movement. Regardless it is mesmerizing!

Timberdoodles love to move through leaf litter and primarily are found in the eastern half of the United States and are most active in March. As they are camouflaged well in the leaves they prefer wooded areas, or really anywhere they can hide in brush. What is most important to a Timberdoodle though is finding a nice field to do its flight displays at dusk for finding a potential mate. Of all the birds I have had the opportunity to observe, Timberdoodles have the most impressive display. They rocket up into the air by circling up to about 300 feet (where we unfortunately can't really see them). When males do these displays their wings make a unique "tweeting" sound which helps draw the attention of potential mates. When the reach the top, it will sing, and then nearly free fall back down to the ground in a zig-zag pattern before quickly gliding to a stop. For this entire display they will start and stop in the same location. Males will continue this display for up to an hour at times. 

If you would like to learn more about the American Woodcock, I highly recommend joining ebird to check out latest sightings of them, and to enjoy other videos and recordings of them. Unfortunately if you are in the western half of the United States, you will need to make a trip out east to see them. [Check out ebird]("https://ebird.org/species/amewoo") 

If you have never heard what a male Timberdoodle's call sounds like, hear a recording of their PEENT below:

#### Where do Timberdoodles go? 
As mentioned before Timberdoodles almost never cross over the "middle" of the United States. This is one of things I lament about living in Colorado, because it is impossible to see these bird's flight displays here. However, when they do somewhat cross the center line of the US, this happens during migration. They have two key migration periods. In the spring (March-May) they can move up the east coast into Canada and skim across Northern US states like Minnesota and Wisconsin. In the winter (September-November) they move back down south, but always staying to the eastern half of the United States. 

##### Think! 
Knowing this new information, I invite you to go back to the ebird link from earlier and look at the range map of sightings. Do you notice anything odd? That's right, we have Timberdoodle sightings where they shouldn't be! Most of these "sightings" are misidentifications, especially in the Southwest. How can we be sure these sightings are a mistake by too-enthusiatic birders? We can look at American Woodcocks that have been tracked by ebird. Fun fact, ebird is managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. While the original link I gave you to explore links to the more public-friend ebird page for American Woodcocks, going forward we will need to review [Cornell Labs full report](https://birdsoftheworld.org/bow/species/amewoo/cur/introduction) on our favorite bird. 

#### Comparing what we know about migration
While I knew the lives of Timberdoodles from my birder co-worker (the amazing Dr. Kimberley Garrett!), here we can see more clearly that the migration paths of these birds do not match up with the range map of sightings on ebird. Let's compare them side by side (or top to bottom depending on your screen size).

You can expand this map on the [ebird](https://ebird.org/species/amewoo) page for the American Woodcock

You will notice that some of the range map sightings do line up with the migration flight maps from Cornell Labs. But let's see this migration path in motion.

#### Migration in motion
We can use occurance data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility [(GBIF)](https://www.gbif.org/), for the American Woodcock or Scolopax minor (J.F.Gmelin, 1789). But why are we using GBIF and not just range data from eBird? eBird data is not vetted by outside sources where GBIF has a variety of controls and standardization practices which makes their data more reliable, applicable and accurate for our comparison.

For those of you interested, here is the longer more detailed reason why GBIF is better:
GBIF provides a uniquely comprehensive and standardized repository of species‐occurrence data, drawing from thousands of sources including museum specimens, government surveys, research networks, environmental DNA projects, and citizen‐science platforms such as eBird. Unlike single-source systems, GBIF harmonizes all incoming records through Darwin Core metadata standards (i.e., standard file formats) and applies transparent, automated data-quality checks that flag issues in taxonomy, geolocation, duplication, temporal accuracy, and metadata completeness. This consistent validation, combined with integration into a global taxonomic backbone, allows users to trace records to their source and filter by quality metrics tailored to analytical needs. While eBird offers exceptionally high-resolution data for birds, GBIF provides broader taxonomic coverage, richer metadata, and a standardized quality-control framework that enhances interoperability and makes its occurrence data particularly suited for comparative, cross-taxa, and global ecological analyses. [Learn even MORE about GBIF controls](https://www.gbif.org/data-quality-requirements-occurrences)

We will use occurence data from 2022 to visualize migration patterns from January to November. Explore the slider below and see how this migration map compares to the eBird range map and the static migration path map from Cornell Labs.

#### Migration wrap-up

So what have we learned about Timberdoodles and their movements? First, if anyone tells you they saw one in California you can tell them they are mistaken. Second, it is important to compare a variety of sources when trying to understand any phenomenon. Looking across our three sources, we see that the GBIF plotted map and the Cornell Labs map line up pretty nicely. We can also see that spring and winter migration pattern discussed earlier where American Woodcocks can be sighted more north in the spring (see the March and April months in the map above), compared to the winter (see November in the map above). 


### Climate Change in Boulder, CO

#### Annual Average Temperatures Show a Gradual Warming Trend? Take a second look!
The fitted trend line reveals a small but consistent increase in average annual temperature over time, with a slope of 0.0326 °F per year. That seems like a small increase however, if we look across the 100 years or so, we do see a significant increase in temperature. We also see year to year variability, especially in the 1930s, 1940s and the late 1990s. The R² value (0.0841) of the OLS regression also indicates that there is variability. However, just because temperatures have been fluxuating does not mean we should ignore the gradual increase in temperature the graph shows.

For example, we can calculate the total temperature change from 1893 to 2023 in Boulder, CO by taking the average temperature change by year (the slope of the trend line) and multiply that by the total number of years. The given slope is 0.0326 °F per year. For Boulder, CO we have temperature data from 1893 to 2023 or 130 years. If we take the slope of 0.0326 °F and multiply it by 130 years we get a total temperature change of 4.2 °F! Suddenly that gradual trend line looks a lot more serious. It is important to keep in mind that we only have temperature data from the last 130 years. If we had larger data modeled back through time we would see a much sharper increase (like with global averages).

# H2OPE Project
![H2OPE Project](img/H2OPE_project.png)

The H2OPE (pronounced hope) project emerged after my time with the Social Science Environmental Health Research Institute, where I worked within the Water Equity Team (WET) Lab. H2OPE is an extension of the original research I started under WET, and supports both undergraduate and graduate students interested in studying socio-environmental problems related to water poverty, water equity, and water accessibility. Located at the intersection of equity, public health, and climate, H2OPE produces policy relevant research on how to address modern water issues in the United States.

## Current Projects

- Water Utility Scorecard and Affordability Dashboard: Being produced using R Shiny, the WUSA Dashboard will have data from 226 water utilities, including a scorecard function which grades water utilities on how well their existing assistance programs facilitate affordability and equity. The dashboard will be publicly accessible in 2026.

- Water Affordability and the Climate Gap: This research arm focuses on current issues with customer assistance programs, poverty and worsening climate change (e.g.,* drought and floods) affects on water utilities. Recognizing the climate gap (see Morello‑Frosch and Obasogie, 2023), this project focuses on how the disparate burden of climate change affects the health and well-being of low-income and racially marginalized groups when it comes to water affordability. Using county-level poverty data, flood and drought data, this on-going project assesses the extent to which existing assistance programs meet local poverty needs. Using current water rate projections under climate stress, we are also identifying future trends on the widening water affordability and climate gap.

- Water Policy and Capital Investment Plans (CIPs): This research arm focuses on the social and environmental values embedded in water utilities CIPs to investigate the environmental moral convergence or divergence of water operators. Compared to the water utility’s mission and other programs, this analysis highlights the extent to which utilities fulfill their expressed environmental beliefs.
