Welcome! I am Kayleigh Ward, an environmental sociologist, community engaged researcher, and public health advocate. 

I am research faculty within the Environmental Science Innovation and Impact Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder, and a lecturer with the Department of Public Health and Health Sciences at Northeastern University. I am a environmental sociologist, public health advocate and policy scholar who investigates how public water utilities’ values, governance, and policy designs shape water affordability, water poverty and environmental justice in the United States. In broader contexts, I focuse on disparate burdens and impacts, by highlighting how environmental health of both urban and rural populations suffer from poor social and environmental policy. Across these difference issues, I use actionable, public-facing evidence to translate findings into practical recommendations to improve equity, reduce water poverty and support just, sustainable infrastructure in urban and rural communities.

As a fun fact, I did many years of disaster work in Japan, in a community called Minamisanriku. See a map of Minamisanriku and their fishing boundaries below! I frequently still give talks on small scale fisheries.

### Climate Change in Boulder, CO

#### Annual Average Temperatures Show a Gradual Warming Trend? Take a second look!
The fitted trend line reveals a small but consistent increase in average annual temperature over time, with a slope of 0.0326 °F per year. That seems like a small increase however, if we look across the 100 years or so, we do see a significant increase in temperature. We also see year to year variability, especially in the 1930s, 1940s and the late 1990s. The R² value (0.0841) of the OLS regression also indicates that there is variability. However, just because tempatures have been fluxuating does not mean it is not increasing overall.

For example, Let \(\Delta T_{F}\) be the change in temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. The given slope is \(0.0326\) °F per year. The change in temperature is calculated by multiplying the slope by the number of years.\(\Delta T_{F}=\text{slope}\times T\). For Boulder, CO we have temperature data from 1893 to 2023 or 130 years. If we take the slope of 0.0326 °F and multiply it by 130 we get a total temperature change of 4.2 °F! Suddenly that gradual trend line looks more serious. It is important to keep in mind that we only have temperature data from the last 130 years. If we had larger data modeled back through time we would see a much sharper increase (like with global averages).

### Minamisanriku

The above image shows the land and sea boundaries of Minamisanriku, Miyagi, Japan where I did much of my graduate school fieldwork. The community is very rural with less than 10,000 people. The community mostly relies on foresty, agriculture and aquaculture for their income.

# H2OPE Project
![H2OPE Project](img/H2OPE_project.png)

The H2OPE (pronounced hope) project emerged after my time with the Social Science Environmental Health Research Institute, where I worked within the Water Equity Team (WET) Lab. H2OPE is an extension of the original research I started under WET, and supports both undergraduate and graduate students interested in studying socio-environmental problems related to water poverty, water equity, and water accessibility. Located at the intersection of equity, public health, and climate, H2OPE produces policy relevant research on how to address modern water issues in the United States.

## Current Projects

- Water Utility Scorecard and Affordability Dashboard: Being produced using R Shiny, the WUSA Dashboard will have data from 226 water utilities, including a scorecard function which grades water utilities on how well their existing assistance programs facilitate affordability and equity. The dashboard will be publicly accessible in 2026.

- Water Affordability and the Climate Gap: This research arm focuses on current issues with customer assistance programs, poverty and worsening climate change (e.g.,* drought and floods) affects on water utilities. Recognizing the climate gap (see Morello‑Frosch and Obasogie, 2023), this project focuses on how the disparate burden of climate change affects the health and well-being of low-income and racially marginalized groups when it comes to water affordability. Using county-level poverty data, flood and drought data, this on-going project assesses the extent to which existing assistance programs meet local poverty needs. Using current water rate projections under climate stress, we are also identifying future trends on the widening water affordability and climate gap.

- Water Policy and Capital Investment Plans (CIPs): This research arm focuses on the social and environmental values embedded in water utilities CIPs to investigate the environmental moral convergence or divergence of water operators. Compared to the water utility’s mission and other programs, this analysis highlights the extent to which utilities fulfill their expressed environmental beliefs.
